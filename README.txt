First of all, if you are getting the code from zip file that means all the packages and modules are already installed and
you just need to install nodejs in your pc and you are good to go. After opening the code, you need to open the terminal. 
then for running frontend you need to access the client from your terminal by using (cd) command.
after accessing the client file you need to run a command that is "npm start" and boom your frontend development server will be started.
Now for starting backend server, you just need to access server file from the command just like before and then run a command "nodemon server.js" 
and the backend server will be started.

Now, if you are gettin only the code files without preinstalled packages and modules then you need to run a command "npm install" in client 
and this will install all the packages for frontend. Now in the server you need to run "npm i express mongoose nodemon" this will install mongodb and express modules
and then you need to install some more modules like: "npm install dotenv" ,  "npm install stipe" , "npm install bcryptjs" , "npm install alert" ,
 "npm install cookie-parser" ,  "npm install cors" ,  "npm install jsonwebtoken" , "npm install multer" , "npm install uuid" . 
and then after successfully installing these modules you can run the server by "nodemon server.js" command.
